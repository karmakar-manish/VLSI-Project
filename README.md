# HLS Optimization for Hand-Written Digit Recognition

This project focuses on optimizing High-Level Synthesis (HLS) code for handwritten digit recognition. It trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to optimize the HLS code for efficient implementation of a CNN on FPGA hardware using Vivado HLS and HLS4ML. 

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- [Vivado HLS](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html)
- [HLS4ML](https://fastmachinelearning.org/hls4ml/)

## Dataset

We use the MNIST training dataset, which includes 60,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is 28x28 pixels in grayscale.
